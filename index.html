            <p>My name is Jack Spreen and I wanted to thank you for visiting my site. My hope is that I will be able to
                tell you about myself and how I ended up here. Growing up I always new that I wanted to be apart of
                something bigger than myself. I was inspired at a young age to pursue a career in healthcare. Having
                studied the human body for close to a decade, it is astonishing how medicine has altered the prognosis
                of the human life. However, I am currently seeking a new challenge. It has become clear that the use of
                technology is going to shape the future of healthcare. I am excited for this change and would find great
                fufillment contributing to this progression. Therefore I have begun a journey in order understand the
                fundementals of programing. </p>
